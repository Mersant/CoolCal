# CoolCal
 
CoolCal (AKA GucciCal) is a splendid app for the fashionistas of our modern world. With a sleek UI, color coding events, you'll never miss a clothing drop again!

It uses the Moment JS library for tracking the time. Each timeslot is stored individually in localStorage so that user data will persist after the browser window is closed.
